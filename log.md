# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 3: May 3, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Did some JS lessons on Free Code Camp and worked on a SQL stored procedure for work

**Thoughts** The JS stuff is pretty easy, I assumed it would be difficult but I think my knowledge in C#, Delphi and toying with JS in the past has helped to really make JS seem easy so far. I know the challenged will come but it's a great confidence booster to move through it like butter. Also worked on a SQL stored proc today, made my company 125 an hour for the custom work for a client, things like that really show me how much my abilities are worth.

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the personal portfolio challenge @ FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts** I've really needed to do a portfolio for a long time now, this challenge gives me something to really sink my teeth into.

### Day 1: May 1, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Coded through the entire HTML section on Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts** HTML is an old friend but I've used CMS for so long that I really needed to get back to basics. Worked on the tribute page challenge.

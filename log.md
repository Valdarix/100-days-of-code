# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 11: May 11, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Day 11 has been challenging, Working through the intermediate algorithms has made my head spin today. It's hard not to just Google the answers and move on. I write algorithms all the time but these just seem to be pushing me. 

**Thoughts**: I despise these algorithms. Looping for the sake of looping, much easier when I am solving a real world problem.

### Day 10: May 10, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Wrapped up the Twitch API app for Free Code Camp today. Quite happy with how it all turned out. 

**Thoughts**: I could have made this asthetically better for sure, but that seems to be my downfall currently. Finding the desire to spend time on CSS is really not something I can do at the moment.

### Day 9: May 9, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I got to read up on the Twitch API but that is about all I was able to get done today for #100 DaysOFCode

**Thoughts**: Today was pretty much a wash as far as getting anything productive done. It was my 15th Wedding Anniversary today so I wasn't able to any coding after work however I did get in several hours of coding (non-work code) while at work. I also had a chance to read up on the TwitchAPI for my next Free Code Camp project. 

### Day 8: May 8, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finally sorted out the Wikipedia API calls. It ended up being something really stupid in the end. But solving the problem is half the challenge, right? Finished the main function of the wikipedia viewer but it's not what I truly want it to be. I did go above and beyond other samples however in that my viewer includes a snippet of the article for the viewer to read before they click over to wikipedia. CSS on the page could be better but I find myself struggling to care about the overall look of the pages at this point. 

**Thoughts**: I wish I had gotten more done today and that I could care about CSS but truth be told I just want to move through this so I can study up more on layout tools like Bootstap, CSS Grid, etc. 



### Day 7: May 7, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today was 1 step foward and 5 steps back on Free Code Camp. The Wikipedia API was giving me fits and I know it's becuase I am struggling with AJAX calls. I was able to get the general design done and looked at a few examples, but nothing clicked. 

**Thoughts**: I coded today, thats about all I can say. Time was spent coding. Will I be able to pick it up tomorrow with fresh eyes?

### Day 6: May 6, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Today I was able to finish up the local weather application for Free Code Camp. It's not pretty but it uses bootstrap which I am finding I like more and more each day. 

**Thoughts**: Today was a challenge to find motivation. Spent most of my 3 hours coding on about 10 lines of code and it was a bit frustrating to say the least. Howeer I finished the project and look forward to tackling the next one.

### Day 5: May 5, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Today was spent on the first challenge for Free Code Camps jQuery/Ajax projects. The first was a Random Quote Generator that would tweet to your twitter account. Pretty fun challenge and another project to add to my portgolio. Like the others I will go back and do some clean up work on them at a later date.

**Thoughts**: Today was fun. Got to work with APIs and JSON and everything was suprisingly easy to work with. I did this project without Bootstrap and I think it made me appreaciate Bootstrap so much more. Can't wait for the next challenge.

### Day 4: May 4, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today was hard! Finally! worked through the JS Algorithims on FreeCodeCamp. A few were really tricky. Also got to decrypt a Casear cypher which was cool since I wrote a Casesar Cypher encrypter for CS50 on EdX a few years ago in C. 

**Thoughts** I realize that I need to spend some time really digging into algorithims. Most of the stuff tossed at me was trivial once I wrapped my head around it but getting there was a challenge on a few of them. Will have to find some good materials on algorithms.

### Day 3: May 3, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Did some JS lessons on Free Code Camp and worked on a SQL stored procedure for work

**Thoughts** The JS stuff is pretty easy, I assumed it would be difficult but I think my knowledge in C#, Delphi and toying with JS in the past has helped to really make JS seem easy so far. I know the challenged will come but it's a great confidence booster to move through it like butter. Also worked on a SQL stored proc today, made my company 125 an hour for the custom work for a client, things like that really show me how much my abilities are worth.

### Day 2: May 2, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the personal portfolio challenge @ FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts** I've really needed to do a portfolio for a long time now, this challenge gives me something to really sink my teeth into.

### Day 1: May 1, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Coded through the entire HTML section on Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts** HTML is an old friend but I've used CMS for so long that I really needed to get back to basics. Worked on the tribute page challenge.

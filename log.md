# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 7: May 7, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today was 1 step foward and 5 steps back on Free Code Camp. The Wikipedia API was giving me fits and I know it's becuase I am struggling with AJAX calls. I was able to get the general design done and looked at a few examples, but nothing clicked. 

**Thoughts**: I coded today, thats about all I can say. Time was spent coding. Will I be able to pick it up tomorrow with fresh eyes?


### Day 6: May 6, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Today I was able to finish up the local weather application for Free Code Camp. It's not pretty but it uses bootstrap which I am finding I like more and more each day. 

**Thoughts**: Today was a challenge to find motivation. Spent most of my 3 hours coding on about 10 lines of code and it was a bit frustrating to say the least. Howeer I finished the project and look forward to tackling the next one.

### Day 5: May 5, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Today was spent on the first challenge for Free Code Camps jQuery/Ajax projects. The first was a Random Quote Generator that would tweet to your twitter account. Pretty fun challenge and another project to add to my portgolio. Like the others I will go back and do some clean up work on them at a later date.

**Thoughts**: Today was fun. Got to work with APIs and JSON and everything was suprisingly easy to work with. I did this project without Bootstrap and I think it made me appreaciate Bootstrap so much more. Can't wait for the next challenge.

### Day 4: May 4, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today was hard! Finally! worked through the JS Algorithims on FreeCodeCamp. A few were really tricky. Also got to decrypt a Casear cypher which was cool since I wrote a Casesar Cypher encrypter for CS50 on EdX a few years ago in C. 

**Thoughts** I realize that I need to spend some time really digging into algorithims. Most of the stuff tossed at me was trivial once I wrapped my head around it but getting there was a challenge on a few of them. Will have to find some good materials on algorithms.

### Day 3: May 3, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Did some JS lessons on Free Code Camp and worked on a SQL stored procedure for work

**Thoughts** The JS stuff is pretty easy, I assumed it would be difficult but I think my knowledge in C#, Delphi and toying with JS in the past has helped to really make JS seem easy so far. I know the challenged will come but it's a great confidence booster to move through it like butter. Also worked on a SQL stored proc today, made my company 125 an hour for the custom work for a client, things like that really show me how much my abilities are worth.

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the personal portfolio challenge @ FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts** I've really needed to do a portfolio for a long time now, this challenge gives me something to really sink my teeth into.

### Day 1: May 1, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Coded through the entire HTML section on Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts** HTML is an old friend but I've used CMS for so long that I really needed to get back to basics. Worked on the tribute page challenge.
